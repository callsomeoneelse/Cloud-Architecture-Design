**Serverless and Event-Driven Architecture for Scalable Web Applications**
==========================================================================

**Overview**
------------

This project implements a **serverless and event-driven architecture** for a scalable web application using AWS services. The solution removes the need for server maintenance while **automating scalability, optimizing costs, and improving efficiency**.

**Architecture**
----------------

### **Key Components:**

1.  **Amazon Route 53** -- DNS web service that connects users to the application.
2.  **Amazon Cognito** -- Provides identity verification and security features for authentication.
3.  **Amazon CloudFront** -- Content delivery network (CDN) for serving static assets from an S3 bucket, ensuring low latency and global availability.
4.  **Amazon S3** -- Stores static website content, user-uploaded photos/videos, and metadata.
5.  **Amazon API Gateway** -- Enables interaction between the frontend and backend services while improving performance.
6.  **AWS Lambda** -- Provides serverless compute functions that process user requests dynamically.
7.  **Amazon DynamoDB** -- A NoSQL database used to store metadata records for uploaded media.
8.  **Amazon SNS & SQS** -- Implements messaging and decouples services to ensure efficient processing.
9.  **AWS Step Functions** -- Orchestrates Lambda functions, automating workflows and scaling efficiently.
10. **Amazon Elastic Transcoder** -- Converts video uploads into a playable format.
11. **Amazon Rekognition** -- AI-powered image analysis for object detection and content moderation.
12. **AWS CloudWatch** -- Monitors application performance and logs system metrics.
13. **IAM Roles & Policies** -- Ensures secure access control across AWS services.

### **Workflow:**

1.  Users access the web application via **Route 53**.
2.  **Amazon Cognito** handles authentication and user management.
3.  Static content is served using **CloudFront and S3** for low-latency access.
4.  API requests are processed via **API Gateway**, which triggers **Lambda functions** for business logic execution.
5.  Users can upload photos/videos, invoking a **Lambda function** that stores the file in **S3** and updates metadata in **DynamoDB**.
6.  **SNS** sends notifications to **SQS**, where messages are queued for asynchronous processing.
7.  **Lambda functions** process images/videos:
    -   Images: Processed by **AWS Rekognition**, resized, and stored back in **S3**.
    -   Videos: Converted using **Elastic Transcoder**, then stored back in **S3**.
8.  **CloudWatch** collects performance metrics for monitoring and optimization.

**Key Benefits**
----------------

âœ… **Serverless Architecture** -- Auto-scaling and reduced operational overhead.\
âœ… **Event-Driven Design** -- Resources are used **only when needed**, minimizing costs.\
âœ… **Cost Optimization** -- Pay-per-use model eliminates idle infrastructure costs.\
âœ… **Decoupled Architecture** -- Improves reliability, fault tolerance, and flexibility.\
âœ… **Security & Compliance** -- Cognito authentication, IAM policies, and SQS encryption secure user data.

**Security Implementation**
---------------------------

ðŸ”’ **IAM Roles** -- Each Lambda function has minimal permissions.\
ðŸ”’ **Amazon Cognito** -- Provides authentication for user sign-ins.\
ðŸ”’ **SQS Encryption** -- Ensures data security in message queues.\
ðŸ”’ **S3 Backup** -- Automated backups prevent data loss.
